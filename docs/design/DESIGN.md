# Design Document for Robot Fleet Management Software
## Introduction
In our design document, we will be going over how we plan on developing our robot fleet management system.

## Project Overview
**Our software will help building managers, the customers, manage their fleet of cleaning robots in their building.**

_* Our actual design implementation isn't fully completed yet. We are still in the beginning phases of our Scrum development process._

Potential Design Ideas:

* Retrieval System of Robot Information from Backend Database
* Developers will potentially implement a bug detection system to ensure software has no external issues
