Structure of the CSV File:

The CSV file could have columns for various attributes of the robots, such as:

RobotID: A unique identifier for each robot.
Type: The type of robot (mopping, vacuum, scrubber).
Size: The size of the robot (large, small).
Status: The current status of the robot (e.g., cleaning, charging, offline, maintenance).
BatteryLevel: The current battery level of the robot.
Location: The current location or room the robot is in.
LastMaintenanceDate: The date when the robot last went through maintenance.
CurrentTask: The current task the robot is performing (if any).

It should incorporate it in this way:

I think we should have a CSV file that that we insert into the command line that gets repeatedly read on to and queried from that 
changes throughout the simulation. When the program turns off, the CSV file can be left off with the information that 
maintained after the previous simulation. it should set up the initialization of the system in my opinion
