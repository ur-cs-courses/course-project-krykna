# Libraries

Our supporting libraries live within their own subfolders:
- `manage` - contains the header file/library for Management implementation file
- `libroom` - contains the header file/library for room implementation file
- `libRobot` - contains the header file/library for Robot implementation file

The corresponding implementation files can be found in the [src](src\SRC.md) directory.

We also added a header only file for [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/tutorial.md#top) testing
